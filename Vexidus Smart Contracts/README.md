## Vexidus Smart Contracts ##

Vexidus Smart Contracts, VSC, are unique contracts created specifically for our chain. These contracts are similar to ERC
contracts but are written in Rust like Solana rather than Solidarity.

## Contract Types ##

*VCS-7: Similar to ERC20 or Solana SPL
*VSC-22: For all non-fungible token (NFT) contracts
*VSC-55: Multi-token contracts

## Launching a VSC7 Contract ##

These contracts are created automatically on chain via VexForge at https://vexforge.xyz. Any users may visit the website and 
connect their wallet with $VXS to launch a token.
