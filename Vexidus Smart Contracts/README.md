## Vexidus Smart Contracts ##

Vexidus Smart Contracts (VSC) are token standards created specifically for the Vexidus blockchain. These standards are similar to ERC contracts but are written in Rust like Solana rather than Solidity.

## Contract Types ##

- **VSC-7**: Fungible tokens — similar to ERC-20 or Solana SPL
- **VSC-21**: Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) — similar to ERC-721
- **VSC-55**: Multi-token contracts — similar to ERC-1155

## Launching a VSC-7 Token ##

These tokens are created automatically on-chain via VexForge at https://vexforge.xyz. Any user may visit the website and connect their wallet with $VXS to launch a token.

## Launching a VSC-21 NFT Collection ##

NFT collections can be created via VexForge Studio or the SDK. See the [developer documentation](https://docs.vexidus.io/token-standards/overview) for details.

## Launching a VSC-55 Multi-Token ##

Multi-token contracts (fungible + non-fungible in one collection) can be created via VexForge Studio or the SDK. See the [developer documentation](https://docs.vexidus.io/token-standards/overview) for details.
